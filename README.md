TCO-Marathon-Match-2
====================

My solution for the Top Coder Open Marathon Match 2 in 2012. This code got me 74th out of 132.

[Here is a link to the problem on TopCoder][].

Essentially the problem was to add squares that contain 4 lines in them in such a way that they create the longest possible line. The hard part is the fact that you only get one square at a time, and you only have 2 active lines to add squares to after the first 2 squares have been placed, meaning if they both loop then you can’t add more squares.

Below is a screenshot of the complete map (left) and a zoomed in version (right).
